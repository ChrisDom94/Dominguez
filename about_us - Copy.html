      We are a company fully dedicated to Photography. We want to make photos
      online easier for customers by giving them options.
    </p>
    <p>
      Customers can chose digital only if they only want the photos in a file
      for uploading or on their own projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if they want something physical they can choose that too and still get
      the digital to give them options.
    </p>
    <p>
      We promise to always put a customers experience at the center of
      everything we do and always number 1.
